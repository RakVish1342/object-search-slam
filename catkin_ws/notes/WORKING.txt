Seems like selecting covariance matrix R and Q properly was the key.

---
Following combos work (For linear and angular velocity cases):
R = 0.05, 0.05, 0.05
Q = 0, 0
---
R = 0.05, 0.05, 0.05
Q = 0.005, 0.005

Following does NOT work:
R = 0.05, 0.05, 0.005
Q = 0, 0
---
R = 0.05, 0.05, 0.005
Q = 0.005, 0.005
