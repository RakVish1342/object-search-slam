Now, compared to when lidar and a single obstacle was used, the updates for the arc don't change as accurately back from -2.8 to +2.8 due to simulation error/drift anymore since only motion model is being used at that point, which does not have any idea about that simulation drift. 

Only reason lidar model could correct that unexpected motion drift earlier was because the obstacle was still in reach of the lidar scan. So this might seem like a slight setback or mistake, but code is actually functioning fine.
